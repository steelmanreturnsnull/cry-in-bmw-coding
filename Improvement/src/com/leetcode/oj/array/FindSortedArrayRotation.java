/**
 * Implement the following function, FindSortedArrayRotation, 
 * which takes as its input an array of unique integers that has been sorted in ascending order, 
 * then rotated by an unknown amount X where 0 <= X <= (arrayLength - 1). 
 * An array rotation by amount X moves every element array[i] to array[(i + X) % arrayLength]. 
 * FindSortedArrayRotation discovers and returns X by examining the array.
